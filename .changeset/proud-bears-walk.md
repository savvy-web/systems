## Features

### `savvy lint init` and `savvy commit init` manage a post-commit hook (#122)

`savvy lint init` and `savvy commit init` now create and manage a `.husky/post-commit` hook that restores the executable bit on shell scripts after each commit. This mirrors the existing post-checkout and post-merge hygiene hooks, closing the gap where a commit could strip the execute permission from the very hooks that `post-checkout`/`post-merge` maintained.

## Bug Fixes

### Missing `@effect/*` peers no longer crash the `savvy` CLI or `savvy-mcp` server at load (#126)

`@savvy-web/cli` and `@savvy-web/mcp` now declare `@effect/cluster`, `@effect/rpc`, and `@effect/sql` as direct dependencies. The `@effect/platform-node` root barrel eagerly links these clustering submodules at import time. Without these declarations, a fresh install that did not already provide them indirectly would fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before any command could run.

### Changeset push-guard no longer blocks tag and delete pushes (#124)

The `changeset-push-guard` plugin hook no longer triggers on `git push --tags`, `git push --delete`/`-d`, or refspec-deletion pushes (`git push origin :branch`). These push forms cannot introduce unreleased commits, so blocking them on an unreleased-changeset check was a false positive.
