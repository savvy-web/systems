# GitHub Action Effects - Architecture

Effect-based utility library for building robust, well-logged, and
schema-validated GitHub Actions with Node.js 24. Zero CJS dependencies --
all `@actions/*` packages replaced with native ESM implementations using
Effect primitives and the GitHub Actions runtime protocol.

## Current State

The library provides 37 Effect service interfaces plus 6 namespace/utility
objects spanning core action I/O, GitHub API integration, git operations,
build tooling, attestation, and a runtime layer that implements the GitHub
Actions protocol natively (no `@actions/*` packages).

## Overview

`@savvy-web/github-action-effects` is an unopinionated utility library providing
Effect services for GitHub Actions built with [`@savvy-web/github-action-builder`](../github-action-builder/architecture.md)
(or any Node.js 24 action). Users compose these services into their own Effect
programs. The library does not dictate how actions are structured -- it provides
building blocks.

**Package:** `@savvy-web/github-action-effects`
**Location:** `packages/github-action-effects` in `savvy-web/systems`

### Scope

The library provides 37 service interfaces, 6 utility namespaces, and a growing
error and schema catalog. Services cover six domains:

- **Core action I/O** -- outputs, state, logging, environment, cache
- **Git operations** -- branches, commits, tags via Git Data API
- **GitHub API** -- REST client, GraphQL, releases, issues, PR lifecycle, PR
  comments, check runs, workflow dispatch, app auth, rate limiting, content
  reading, commit graph, artifact metadata
- **Build tooling** -- command execution, npm registry, package publishing,
  workspace detection, package manager adaptation, tool installation, changeset
  analysis, config loading
- **Attestation** -- in-toto/SLSA statement construction, Sigstore signing, CycloneDX SBOM generation, full attest-and-upload workflow
- **Runtime layer** -- native implementations of the GitHub Actions workflow
  command protocol, environment file appending, ConfigProvider for `INPUT_*`
  variables, Effect Logger integration, and the Step buffered-logging primitive

### Problem Statement

GitHub Actions development suffers from four recurring pain points:

1. **Brittle error handling** -- Actions fail fast on first error, making
   monorepo builds that should report partial results instead crash entirely
2. **Noisy logging** -- Raw command output floods the console, making debugging
   with LLMs or human eyes difficult; no structured log levels
3. **Unvalidated inputs** -- JSON strings passed between workflows have no schema
   validation; GitHub's input validation is minimal
4. **Manual reporting** -- Building GFM tables for check run summaries and PR
   comments requires repetitive string concatenation

### Design Principles

- **Utility-first** -- Provide composable services, not an opinionated framework
- **Effect-native** -- All services are Effect services with proper Layer composition
- **Zero @actions/* dependencies** -- All platform interactions use native ESM
  implementations: `WorkflowCommand` for the `::command::` protocol,
  `RuntimeFile` for environment file appending, `ActionsConfigProvider` for
  reading `INPUT_*` env vars, and `ActionsLogger` for the Effect Logger.
  Direct dependencies on `@octokit/rest` and `@octokit/auth-app` replace
  `@actions/github`. `@azure/storage-blob` is used for cache transfers.
- **Peer dependencies** -- `effect`, `@effect/platform`, and
  `@effect/platform-node` are required peers. Users bring their own versions.
- **Single entry point** -- One barrel export at `@savvy-web/github-action-effects`
- **Incrementally adoptable** -- Use one service or all of them; no all-or-nothing

## Runtime Layer

The `packages/github-action-effects/src/runtime/` directory contains native implementations of the GitHub
Actions runtime protocol, replacing all `@actions/*` packages:

- **`WorkflowCommand`** -- Formats and issues `::command key=value::message`
  protocol strings to stdout. Handles escaping of `%`, `\r`, `\n`, `:`, `,`.
- **`RuntimeFile`** -- Appends key-value pairs to GitHub Actions environment
  files (`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_STATE`, `GITHUB_PATH`).
  Supports multiline values via the delimiter protocol.
- **`ActionsConfigProvider`** -- A `ConfigProvider` that reads `INPUT_*`
  environment variables. Converts config keys to the `INPUT_` prefix format
  (uppercase, spaces to underscores, hyphens preserved).
- **`ActionsLogger`** -- An Effect `Logger` that maps log levels to workflow
  commands: Debug/Trace to `::debug::`, Info to plain stdout, Warning to
  `::warning::`, Error/Fatal to `::error::`. Forwards `file`, `line`, `col`
  annotations as command properties.
- **`ActionsRuntime.Default`** -- Single convenience Layer wiring everything
  together: ConfigProvider, Logger, ActionLogger, ActionOutputs, ActionState,
  ActionEnvironment, and NodeFileSystem.
- **`Step`** -- Step-buffered logging primitive. `Step.withStep(name, effect)` opens a per-step debug buffer, emits one `✅ <name>: <line>` info line on success (discarding the buffer) and spills the buffer as `│ [DEBUG]` / `│ [INFO]` lines under a `❌ <name>: <error>` header on failure. Nested calls track depth via a fiber-local stack (`StepStack`). Warnings and errors always pass through to GitHub Actions workflow commands — buffering only applies to debug and info. `Step.success(line)` sets the custom success summary for the current step. `Step.collapse(steps, reducer)` runs N steps in parallel; if the reducer returns a string, one collapsed line is emitted instead of N per-step lines. `Step.groupStep(name, effect)` wraps an effect in both `ActionLogger.group` and `withStep`.

The Step buffering logger replaces all pre-installed loggers (including `ActionsLogger`) for the duration of a step via `Effect.locally(FiberRef.currentLoggers, ...)` so debug lines are not double-printed.

Consumer pattern:

```typescript
// Inputs via Effect's Config API (backed by ActionsConfigProvider)
const name = yield* Config.string("name")      // reads INPUT_NAME
const count = yield* Config.integer("count")    // reads INPUT_COUNT

// Logging via Effect Logger (backed by ActionsLogger)
yield* Effect.log("hello")                      // plain stdout
yield* Effect.logDebug("details")               // ::debug::details
yield* Effect.logWarning("caution")             // ::warning::caution

// Option A: Direct layer provision
program.pipe(Effect.provide(ActionsRuntime.Default))

// Option B: Action.run with error handling + buffering
Action.run(program)
```

## Rationale

### Architectural Decisions

#### AD-1: No @actions/* Dependencies

- **Decision:** All `@actions/*` packages removed. The library uses native
  ESM implementations for the GitHub Actions runtime protocol.
- **Rationale:** The `@actions/*` packages are CommonJS, cannot be tree-shaken,
  and create version coupling between the library and consumers. The runtime
  protocol (workflow commands via stdout, environment files) is simple and
  well-documented. Native implementations give full control, better error
  handling via Effect, and zero CJS in the dependency tree.
- **Direct dependencies:** `@octokit/rest` for REST/GraphQL API access,
  `@octokit/auth-app` for GitHub App authentication. These are ESM-compatible
  and provide the Octokit API surface directly.

#### AD-2: Inputs via Config API

- **Decision:** Action inputs are read via Effect's `Config` API backed by
  `ActionsConfigProvider`, not a dedicated `ActionInputs` service.
- **Rationale:** Effect's `Config` API is the idiomatic way to read
  configuration. The `ActionsConfigProvider` maps config keys to `INPUT_*`
  environment variables, matching GitHub Actions behavior. This eliminates a
  dedicated service while providing schema validation, composition, and
  default values through Effect's built-in `Config` combinators.

#### AD-3: Two Entry Points -- Main and Testing Subpath

- **Decision:** Two barrel exports: `index.ts` (main) and `testing.ts`
  (`./testing` subpath export in `package.json`). The `./testing` subpath
  excludes `GitHubClientLive` (which imports `@octokit/rest`),
  `OctokitAuthAppLive` (which imports `@octokit/auth-app`), the `GitHubToken`
  namespace (which imports `GitHubClientLive`), and the `Action`
  namespace (which imports `ActionsRuntime`).
- **Rationale:** Test environments may not have `@octokit/rest` or
  `@octokit/auth-app` installed. The `./testing` subpath lets test files
  import everything they need without triggering those dependency imports.

#### AD-4: Services Over Frameworks

- **Decision:** Export composable Effect services, not an opinionated runner
- **Rationale:** Users may have their own Effect programs, layers, and error
  strategies. Providing services lets them compose freely.

#### AD-5: GFM Builder Standalone from Check Runs

- **Decision:** GFM/markdown builders are independent of the CheckRun service
- **Rationale:** GFM output is used in check run summaries, PR comments, issue
  bodies, and step summaries. Coupling it to check runs would limit reuse.

#### AD-6: Class-Based Context.Tag and Inline Data.TaggedError

- **Decision:** Services use `class Foo extends Context.Tag("github-action-effects/Foo")<Foo, { ... }>() {}`
  and errors use `class FooError extends Data.TaggedError("FooError")<{ ... }> {}`.
- **Rationale:** `Context.GenericTag` is deprecated in modern Effect. The
  class-based `Context.Tag` merges the interface and tag into a single
  declaration. Error types use inline `Data.TaggedError` without a separate
  `Base` export.

#### AD-7: Schema-Based State Serialization

- **Decision:** ActionState uses `Schema.encode` / `Schema.decode` for
  multi-phase state transfer rather than raw JSON.stringify/parse
- **Rationale:** State is persisted via `GITHUB_STATE` environment file and
  read back via `STATE_*` environment variables. Using Effect Schema for the
  round-trip provides type-safe encoding, decode validation, and clear
  `ActionStateError` on phase-ordering bugs.

#### AD-8: Utility Namespaces for Lightweight Abstractions

- **Decision:** Pure computation patterns and thin API wrappers use
  `const X = { ... } as const` namespace objects instead of full services
- **Rationale:** GithubMarkdown, SemverResolver, ErrorAccumulator,
  AutoMerge, and ReportBuilder do not need dependency injection or state
  management. Namespace objects avoid service ceremony while remaining
  api-extractor compatible.

### Constraints

#### Node.js 24 Runtime

GitHub Actions runners support Node.js 24. We can use modern APIs and
ES2024+ features freely (native `fetch`, `crypto.randomUUID()`,
`node:child_process`, etc.).

#### GitHub Actions Runtime Protocol

Actions communicate through environment variables, file-based commands
(`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, `GITHUB_ENV`, `GITHUB_STATE`, `GITHUB_PATH`), and
workflow commands written to stdout (`::command::message`). All services
respect these conventions via the `packages/github-action-effects/src/runtime/` implementations.

#### Bundle Size

Since ncc bundles all dependencies, the Effect library adds to bundle size.
This is acceptable -- Effect tree-shakes well and action bundles are not
size-constrained like browser bundles.
