/**
 * Rewrite a default import / default re-export of a Node built-in into the
 * equivalent NAMESPACE form, so rolldown's CJS codegen produces correct interop.
 *
 * Why this exists — a rolldown 1.1.0 codegen defect (verified against the latest
 * published rolldown 1.1.0 / tsdown 0.22.2, with no newer release to upgrade to):
 *
 *   // SOURCE (e.g. vfile's lib/minproc.js)
 *   export {default as minproc} from 'node:process'
 *   // ...consumed as minproc.cwd()
 *
 *   // rolldown CJS OUTPUT (BROKEN)
 *   let node_process = require("node:process");
 *   node_process.default.cwd()           // <- require("node:process").default is undefined
 *
 * For a default import of an EXTERNAL Node builtin, rolldown emits a bare
 * `require("node:x")` WITHOUT its `__toESM` interop wrapper, yet still accesses
 * `.default` — which is `undefined` on a builtin's CJS export object, so the call
 * throws `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cwd')` at runtime. NAMED
 * imports are unaffected (`(0, node_process.cwd)()` reads a real property), and a
 * NAMESPACE import is handled correctly: rolldown wraps it as
 * `node_process = __toESM(require("node:process"), 1)`, which synthesizes `.default`
 * and copies every own property, so member access works. This transform converts the
 * broken default form into the working namespace form BEFORE codegen, so it is immune
 * to minification and applies identically to per-module and bundled output.
 *
 * rolldown exposes no Rollup-style `output.interop` knob to fix this at the output
 * layer, which is why the correction happens here on the source.
 *
 * Rewrites (the two static forms that occur in practice, anchored to statement start):
 *  - `import NAME from "node:x"`            -> `import * as NAME from "node:x"`
 *  - `export { default as NAME } from "node:x"` -> `export * as NAME from "node:x"`
 *  - `import NAME, { a, b } from "node:x"`  -> `import * as NAME from "node:x"; import { a, b } from "node:x"`
 *
 * The namespace binding NAME carries the builtin's named exports (`NAME.cwd`,
 * `NAME.join`, ...), which is exactly how a default import of a builtin is consumed
 * in practice. ESM output is unaffected at runtime (a namespace import of a builtin
 * resolves to the same members), so the plugin is safe to attach to dual builds.
